# POMEGRANATE GAME ENGINE (WIP)
![Pomegranate](img/PomegranateEngineText.png)
## About
Pomegranate engine is a 3d game engine. (currently only tested and compiled on linux) It intends to be a nice simple engine, with a readable, minimal UI, and easily modifiable with custom plugins. The engine currently is in pre-alpha, and will probably be there for a long time.
## Compiling

To be honest I barely know how I compiled this. So good luck.  

Assimp, GLFW, and OpenGL are required.

If you are running this on something other than linux you will probably have to compile teascript yourself. https://github.com/RevengerWizard/teascript
## Documentation
Documentation for both Teascript and the engine are WIP.
