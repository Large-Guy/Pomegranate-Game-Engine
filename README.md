## About
Pomegranate engine is a 3d linux game engine. (cross-platform support is planned.) It intends to be a nice simple engine, with a simple, pretty UI, and easily modifiable with custom plugins. The engine currently is in pre-alpha, and will probably be there for a long time.
## Compiling

To be honest I barely know how I compiled this. So good luck.  

Assimp, GLFW, and OpenGL are required.

If you are running this on something other than linux you will probably have to compile teascript yourself. https://github.com/RevengerWizard/teascript
## Documentation
Documentation for both Teascript and the engine are WIP.
